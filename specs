one master container scheduling jobs
    - master is a django app
multiple slave containers doing the work (ex.: downloading html, counting occurrences of a word)
    - slave is just a containers waiting for task, communicating via sockets? django channels?
create a screen that will show a progress (logs from a worked) in real time
    - in master's django app, something like django channel's tutorial chat app / react app?
